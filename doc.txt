Drupal is a free and open-source content-management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is used as a back-end framework for at least 2.1% of all Web sites worldwide ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites including WhiteHouse.gov and data.gov.uk. It is also used for knowledge management and business collaboration.
There are multiple database types supported by this image I have used MSQL(5.7)  in which I have created a user name mahek which can access the database info or we can also use root account. I have also provide it with it's volume name mysto where it stores data. By using Drupal image I have also provide it with volume name drupalvol which depends on the database(db) run on port  8080(localhost)
After making my docker-compose.yml file I ran it by using docker-compose up command It took few seconds to run then we can access it via http://localhost:8080 or http://192.168.43.85:8080 in a browser.
